## 2026-05-26 - Optimized Worker Health Check N+1 Query
**Performance Issue:** N+1 Query in `checkWorkerHealth`.
**Learning:** Checking health for multiple tasks in a loop using `QueryRow` causes multiple database roundtrips.
**Optimization:** Replaced loop-based queries with a single `ANY($1)` query to fetch all task stats at once.
**Impact:** Reduced database queries from 6+ to 1 per health check run.
