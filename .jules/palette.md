## 2024-05-15 - [Add aria-hidden to decorative icons]
**Learning:** Found an accessibility issue pattern where decorative material-symbols-outlined ligature icons lack aria-hidden="true". This causes screen readers to announce the raw ligature text (e.g., "rocket launch" or "warning") out of context, creating a confusing and poor experience for users relying on assistive technologies.
**Action:** Always add aria-hidden="true" to decorative icon span elements to prevent screen readers from reading the internal ligature text. If an icon is purely informative and has no visible text alternative, ensure it has an aria-label or use visually hidden text instead.

## 2026-05-19 - Adding aria-hidden to decorative icons
**Learning:** It's important to add `aria-hidden="true"` to `material-symbols-outlined` span tags, especially in table headers, buttons, and links. If missing, screen readers may read the raw ligature strings like "arrow_upward", "filter_alt_off", or "login", leading to a confusing user experience. Additionally, icon-only interactive elements must have `aria-label` attributes.
**Action:** When adding or modifying material icons, always verify if they are purely decorative and add `aria-hidden="true"` if they are. For icon-only buttons, ensure they have a descriptive `aria-label`.

## 2026-05-25 - Safe Inline Event Handlers
**Learning:** When using inline JavaScript event handlers in Go templates (like `onclick="document.getElementById('target').click()"` for an empty state CTA button), standard property access can cause `TypeError`s if the target element doesn't exist or is removed later.
**Action:** Always use optional chaining (e.g., `document.getElementById('target')?.click()`) for safer, defensive event handler implementations in raw templates.

## 2026-05-28 - ARIA attributes for alert/status containers
**Learning:** Flash messages indicating success or error states need proper ARIA roles to ensure they are immediately announced by screen readers without requiring the user to navigate to them.
**Action:** Use `role="alert" aria-atomic="true"` for error messages and `role="status" aria-live="polite"` for non-critical information/success messages in template partials.
## 2024-05-19 - Missing 'for' attributes in forms
**Learning:** The forms in templates/subscriptions.html were using labels visually but without proper ID and 'for' attribute linking, specifically also when forms are generated in JS logic in templates.
**Action:** When adding accessible forms, check any JS generated HTML inside the `<script>` tags of standard HTML templates, prefix their IDs to ensure uniqueness if the JS form appears multiple times, and correctly use matching `for` and `id` properties.
